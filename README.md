#Created by Jesse Phillips, Jeremy Balemala, Trey Hull and Trevor Carnes

This project is running Django 2.2 and python3. The database is run off of MySql and includes a dump file of the database.

The idea of this project was to teach the students how to create a softawre project following software engineering design principles
and project management standards. 

I(Jesse Phillips) worked mainly on the backend connecting the database tables together and setting up the python that then controls them. I also assisted in creating the user forms that inputed data to the backend.
