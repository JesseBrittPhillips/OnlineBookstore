Running the Django Framework

Install Django Rest Framework from here
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/install/
Make sure to also have python install, additional instructions can also be found for that on the above page.

In order to run the django server in the project directory run 
>python manage.py runserver

The server should then begin running and the specified ip for the website will be shown on the console. go there in a browser and you should see the homepage of the website.


MYSQL

In order to get the mysql workbench follow the instructions here
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
I would install the total package listed in the other downloads section of that link.

There is a dump for the mysql database in the project folder
